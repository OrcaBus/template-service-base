New Here? Start Here
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are not familiar with AWS, Lambda, EventBridge, or CDK, read the beginner guide first:

- [`docs/beginner-guide.md`](docs/beginner-guide.md)

That guide explains:

- what this service does in plain language
- what "stack" means in this repository
- how Lambda, EventBridge, IAM, and CDK fit together
- how deployment works across toolchain and environment stacks
- which files to read first


Using This Template
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository is a working example. To build a real service from it, go through the checklist below.

### 1. Rename the service

| What | Where |
| ---- | ----- |
| Module directory name | Rename `app/hello_world/` to your service name |
| Event source constant | `infrastructure/stage/constants.ts` → `OUTGOING_EVENT_SOURCE` |
| Incoming event filter | `infrastructure/stage/constants.ts` → `INCOMING_WORKFLOW_NAME` |
| Incoming event detail type | `infrastructure/stage/constants.ts` → `INCOMING_DETAIL_TYPE` |
| CDK stack name | `bin/deploy.ts` → `'OrcaBusStatelessHelloWorldStack'` |

### 2. Wire up the stateless pipeline

In `infrastructure/toolchain/stateless-stack.ts`, update:

- `githubRepo` — your new GitHub repository name
- `stackName` — your CloudFormation stack name
- `pipelineName` — your CodePipeline name (convention: `OrcaBus-Stateless{ServiceName}`)

### 3. Decide on stateful infrastructure

If your service needs databases, buckets, or queues: fill in the TODOs in `infrastructure/toolchain/stateful-stack.ts` and `bin/deploy.ts`.

If not: delete `infrastructure/toolchain/stateful-stack.ts` and remove the `stateful` branch from `bin/deploy.ts`.

### 4. Replace the Lambda logic

- `app/hello_world/lambdas/handler.py` — replace the hello-world business logic
- `app/hello_world/models.py` — replace the Pydantic models with your event shapes

### 5. Update tests

- `app/tests/conftest.py` — update the sample event fixture
- `app/tests/test_handler.py` — rewrite tests for your handler
- `test/stage.test.ts` — update CDK assertions to match your stack resources

### 6. Update this README

- Service name, description
- Consumed and published events tables
- Stateless resources list under [Stateless](#stateless)
- Remove the [Using This Template](#using-this-template) section


Service Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Name & responsibility

**Hello World** — a minimal Lambda service template for the OrcaBus platform.

### Description

This service demonstrates the canonical pattern for an event-driven Lambda microservice on OrcaBus:

1. An EventBridge rule filters `WorkflowRunStateChange` events from `orcabus.workflowmanager` for the `hello-world` workflow.
2. The matching events trigger a Python Lambda function.
3. The Lambda parses the incoming event using Pydantic models, extracts key fields, and emits a `HelloWorldEvent` back onto the `OrcaBusMain` event bus.

Use this repository as a starting point when building a new auxiliary service that reacts to OrcaBus events.

### API Endpoints

This service does not expose any API endpoints. It is purely event-driven.

### Consumed Events

| Name / DetailType            | Source                    | Schema Link | Description                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `WorkflowRunStateChange`     | `orcabus.workflowmanager` |             | Fired on every state transition of a workflow run. Filtered to `workflow.name = hello-world`. |

### Published Events

| Name / DetailType   | Source                | Schema Link | Description                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `HelloWorldEvent`   | `orcabus.helloworld`  |             | Emitted after successfully processing a WRSC event. |

### (Internal) Data states & persistence model

This service is stateless. No data is persisted.

### Major Business Rules

- The Lambda only processes events for the `hello-world` workflow (enforced at the EventBridge rule level).
- A failed `put_events` call (non-zero `FailedEntryCount`) raises a `RuntimeError`, causing the Lambda to fail and triggering the standard retry/DLQ behaviour.

### Permissions & Access Control

No authentication or authorisation controls apply. The service is triggered exclusively via EventBridge rules and does not expose any user-facing interface.

### Change Management

#### Versioning strategy

Manual tagging of git commits following Semantic Versioning (semver) guidelines.

#### Release management

The service employs a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and releases all changes to the `main` branch across `beta`, `gamma`, and `prod` environments.


Infrastructure & Deployment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infrastructure is managed via CDK. This template provides two types of CDK entry points: `cdk-stateless` and `cdk-stateful`.

### Stateful

This service has no stateful resources. The `StatefulStack` is kept as a placeholder — if a future version of this service requires databases, buckets, or queues, fill in the TODOs in `infrastructure/toolchain/stateful-stack.ts`.

### Stateless

- **`HelloWorldFunction`** — Python 3.12 ARM64 Lambda, bundled via `PythonLayerVersion` from `app/requirements.txt`.
- **`WorkflowRunStateChangeRule`** — EventBridge rule on `OrcaBusMain` that matches `WorkflowRunStateChange` events where `detail.workflow.name = hello-world`.

### CDK Commands

#### What is `npx` and why do we use it?

`npx` runs a Node.js CLI tool that is installed locally in `node_modules/.bin/` without needing to install it globally. When you see `npx cdk`, it runs the CDK CLI bundled with this project rather than whatever version might be installed on your machine — ensuring everyone uses the same version.

This project also wraps common CDK commands behind `pnpm` scripts (e.g. `pnpm cdk-stateless`) so you rarely need to call `npx cdk` directly. Use `pnpm` scripts when available; fall back to `npx cdk` for one-off or advanced commands.

#### Deploy modes

The `deployMode` context variable controls which stacks are synthesised:

| `deployMode` | Description |
|---|---|
| `stateless` | Lambda functions, EventBridge rules, and other resources that can be redeployed safely |
| `stateful` | Databases, S3 buckets, queues — resources where redeployment may cause data loss |
| `direct` | Synthesises and deploys a specific stack directly to your current AWS credentials without going through CodePipeline — useful for fast iteration in dev |

#### `--require-approval never`

By default CDK will pause and ask for confirmation before creating or modifying IAM roles and security group rules. Passing `--require-approval never` skips that prompt. It is safe to use in development workflows where you own the account, but avoid it in production pipelines.

#### Common commands

```sh
# List all stacks in the project
pnpm cdk-stateless ls

# Deploy the toolchain pipeline (sets up CodePipeline in the bastion account)
pnpm cdk-stateless deploy OrcaBusStatelessHelloWorldStack

# Manually push a stack directly to dev (bypasses CodePipeline, useful for quick iteration)
npx cdk deploy -c deployMode=direct HelloWorldStack --require-approval never

# Manually deploy via the pipeline sub-stack path (beta / dev environment)
pnpm cdk-stateless deploy OrcaBusStatelessHelloWorldStack/DeploymentPipeline/OrcaBusBeta/HelloWorldStack

# Synthesise CloudFormation templates without deploying (good for reviewing changes)
pnpm cdk-stateless synth
```

> **Note:** `direct` mode deploys using your current AWS CLI credentials and region. Make sure you are logged into the correct account (`aws sts get-caller-identity`) before running a direct deploy.

All deployments go through the `DeploymentStackPipeline` construct, which handles cross-account role assumptions and applies the correct per-environment configuration from `config.ts`.

### Stacks

This CDK project manages multiple stacks. The root stack (the only one that does not include `DeploymentPipeline` in its stack ID) is deployed in the toolchain account and sets up a CodePipeline for cross-environment deployments to `beta`, `gamma`, and `prod`.

To list all available stacks, run:

```sh
pnpm cdk-stateless ls
```

Example output:

```sh
OrcaBusStatelessHelloWorldStack
OrcaBusStatelessHelloWorldStack/DeploymentPipeline/OrcaBusBeta/HelloWorldStack  (OrcaBusBeta-HelloWorldStack)
OrcaBusStatelessHelloWorldStack/DeploymentPipeline/OrcaBusGamma/HelloWorldStack (OrcaBusGamma-HelloWorldStack)
OrcaBusStatelessHelloWorldStack/DeploymentPipeline/OrcaBusProd/HelloWorldStack  (OrcaBusProd-HelloWorldStack)
```


Development
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Project Structure

The root of the project is an AWS CDK project where the main application logic lives inside the `./app` folder.

The project is organized into the following key directories:

- **`./app`**: Contains the main application logic. You can open the code editor directly in this folder, and the application should run independently.

- **`./bin/deploy.ts`**: Serves as the entry point of the application. It initializes two root stacks: `stateless` and `stateful`. You can remove one of these if your service does not require it.

- **`./infrastructure`**: Contains the infrastructure code for the project:
  - **`./infrastructure/toolchain`**: Includes stacks for the stateless and stateful resources deployed in the toolchain account. These stacks primarily set up the CodePipeline for cross-environment deployments.
  - **`./infrastructure/stage`**: Defines the stage stacks for different environments:
    - **`./infrastructure/stage/config.ts`**: Contains environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `beta`, `gamma`, `prod`).
    - **`./infrastructure/stage/deployment-stack.ts`**: The CDK stack entry point for provisioning resources required by the application in `./app`.

- **`.github/workflows/pr-tests.yml`**: Configures GitHub Actions to run tests for `make check` (linting and code style), tests defined in `./test`, and `make test` for the `./app` directory. Modify this file as needed to ensure the tests are properly configured for your environment.

- **`./test`**: Contains tests for CDK code compliance against `cdk-nag`. You should modify these test files to match the resources defined in the `./infrastructure` folder.

### Setup

#### Requirements

```sh
node --version
v22.9.0

# Update Corepack (if necessary, as per pnpm documentation)
npm install --global corepack@latest

# Enable Corepack to use pnpm
corepack enable pnpm
```

#### Install Dependencies

To install all required dependencies, run:

```sh
make install
```

#### First Steps

Before using this template, search for all instances of `TODO:` comments in the codebase and update them as appropriate for your service. This includes replacing placeholder values (such as stack names, GitHub repo, and pipeline names).

### Conventions

### Linting & Formatting

Automated checks are enforced via pre-commit hooks, ensuring only checked code is committed. For details consult the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

Manual, on-demand checking is also available via `make` targets. For details consult the `Makefile` in the root of the project.

To run linting and formatting checks on the root project, use:

```sh
make check
```

To also lint the app (Python), use `check-all` — this is what CI runs:

```sh
make check-all
```

To automatically fix issues with ESLint and Prettier, run:

```sh
make fix
```

### Testing

Unit tests are available for the Lambda handler and Pydantic models. Test code is hosted alongside business logic in `./app/tests/`.

```sh
# Python unit tests (no Docker required)
cd app && make test

# CDK infrastructure tests (requires Docker Desktop to be running)
pnpm test
```

> **Note:** The CDK tests synthesize the Lambda layer using Docker. If Docker is not running, `pnpm test` will fail with `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`. Start Docker Desktop before running CDK tests locally.
